Hello! I'm **Pritam Majumder**, an aspiring Data Scientist currently pursuing my **M.Sc. in Data Science** at the **University of Kalyani**.

## ðŸš€ Daily LeetCode Contributions

I am committed to solving **coding problems daily** on **LeetCode**. My goal is to improve my problem-solving skills, deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms, and get ready for technical interviews.

You can find my LeetCode profile here: [https://leetcode.com/sJFUDW8f16/](#) 

### My Approach to Solving Problems
- **Focus on Fundamentals**: Each problem is tackled with a clear understanding of the basic concepts.
- **Optimization**: After solving a problem, I always look for ways to optimize my code for efficiency.
- **Consistent Learning**: I explore different topics, including:
  - **Arrays**
  - **Strings**
  - **Linked Lists**
  - **Dynamic Programming**
  - **Graphs**
  - **Backtracking**

### Tools & Technologies I Use:
- **Languages**: Python, C, R
- **Platforms**: LeetCode, GitHub, StackOverflow


## Why LeetCode?

LeetCode helps me practice real-world problems and stay consistent in improving my coding ability. I believe continuous practice will make me ready for technical challenges in my career as a **data scientist**.
